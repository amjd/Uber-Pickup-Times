Uber-Pickup-Times
=================

A small experiment with Uber API to find available Uber cars around you and along with their ETAs. It uses the HTML5 Geolocation API to get the location.

###Demo

###Usage

```shell
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

```

Run the script and see it live at: `http://localhost:5000`
